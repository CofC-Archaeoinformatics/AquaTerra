{"name":"Aquaterra","tagline":"","body":"Hello, and welcome to the AquaTerra Wiki!\r\n\r\nAquaTerra is a plug-in that interfaces with the ArcGIS geographical mapping software provided by Esri. Our team is adapting and refactoring the prototype with the intention of providing the modified python toolbox to the public. The toolbox prototype was developed by James M.L. Newhard, Norman Levine, and Angelina Phebus.\r\n\r\n[![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ItTj6W4.png)](https://www.academia.edu/10964635/Analyzing_Bronze_Age_Terrestrial_and_Marine_Communication_Routes_in_the_Saronic_Gulf_and_Argolid)\r\n\r\nThis poster outlining the concept was presented in 2011 at the Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in San Antonio, TX, and gives a visual representation of the actions of the toolbox, as well as a basic model of the components in which it works with.  If you have any questions or comments about the AquaTerra project, please contact either [Dr. James Newhard](mailto:NewhardJ@cofc.edu) or [Dr. Norman Levine](mailto:LevineN@cofc.edu) and they will answer you to the best of their ability.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
